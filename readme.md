 basic structure for your Go application that uses GORM, PostgreSQL, the Gin web framework, JWT authentication, and includes various components such as handlers, routes, controllers, utils, models, config, middleware, and user authentication:

├── config/
│   └── config.go         # Configuration settings
├── controllers/
│   ├── auth_controller.go # Authentication-related controllers
│   └── user_controller.go # User-related controllers
├── handlers/
│   └── handlers.go       # HTTP request handlers
├── middleware/
│   ├── auth_middleware.go # JWT authentication middleware

├── models/

│   └── ...               # Other models
├── routes/
│   └── routes.go         # Define application routes
├── utils/
│   └── utils.go          # Utility functions
├── main.go               # Main application entry point
└── go.mod
Here's a brief description of each directory and file:

config/: Contains configuration settings for your application, such as database connection details, JWT secret, etc.

controllers/: Houses controller logic for different parts of your application, such as authentication and user-related operations.

handlers/: Defines HTTP request handlers that call the appropriate controller functions.

middleware/: Contains middleware functions, including JWT authentication middleware and error handling middleware.

models/: Contains your data models, such as the User model and any other models you might need.

routes/: Defines application routes using the Gin framework. This is where you map HTTP routes to specific handlers.

utils/: Houses utility functions that can be used throughout your application.

main.go: The main entry point of your application where you set up the Gin server, configure middleware, and initialize routes.

This is a basic structure, and you can expand it based on the complexity and requirements of your application. Remember to import and use the necessary libraries (e.g., GORM, Gin, JWT libraries) in your code.

config.LoadConfig() would be responsible for loading your application's configuration from a file or environment variables.

The routes.SetupRoutes(router) function would be responsible for defining all your application routes using the Gin router.

Remember to replace "myapp" with the actual name of your Go module and adjust the import paths accordingly.# bookmania
